<P> I am a nineteen year old from Winthrop, Maine. I love dogs, the color blue, and going out to eat. 
I am an alpine ski racer for the University of Maine. I am a freshman this year, majoring in Business 
Law. My favorite movie is Into the Wild and I love all kinds of music, especially anything from the 
70's and 80's. I am addicted to coffee, my favorite drink being a caramel mocha iced coffee from 
Starbucks. In highschool I spent my time playing field hockey and lacrosse, as well as ski racing. I also
was the editor in chief of our newspaper.  <p>
